# RecordType

Currently if the type that is included in the [record](./index.md) is generated by the compiler (for example, [from a macro](../macros/index.md)), the compiler will not be able to compile such a record without us providing additional information.

We can do that by annotating the field with the `[RecordType]` attribute.

```cs
using GenerationAttributes;

[Record] public partial class MyRecord {
  // `GeneratedEnum` is an `enum` type.
  [RecordType(RecordFieldType.Enum)]
  public readonly GeneratedEnum foo;

  // `GeneratedStruct` is a `struct` type.
  [RecordType(RecordFieldType.Struct)]
  public readonly GeneratedStruct bar;

  // `GeneratedClass` is a `class` (reference) type.
  [RecordType(RecordFieldType.Reference)]
  public readonly GeneratedClass baz;
}
```

:::note
This is a current limitation of the compiler and, in the future, it should be possible to compute this while compiling.

However, it is not trivial to do so, so this is the solution for now.
